          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my personal website! I am a healthcare professional with
            over 20 years of experience in rehabilitation and dialysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            My core strength as a healthcare professional lies in my ability to
            create and communicate a shared vision that motivates and inspires
            teams to achieve their goals.

        <p>
          As a healthcare professional, I hold several certificates that have
          helped me refine my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry
          trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes me unique is my belief that the right people are the key to
          success in any workplace. I am passionate about bringing people of
          different backgrounds together to accomplish greater outcomes for the
          vulnerable to chronically ill that normally would not have been possible.
          My values of integrity, persistence, and empathy are at the core of
          everything I do.
